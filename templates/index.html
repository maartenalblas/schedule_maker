     <h1> Create an awesome schedule</h1>
     <p> Create your own class schedule in the blink of an eye. You can use it for university, college or high school. Just upload the data of your particular school and let the hill climbing algorithm do the hard work. The algorithm optimizes your schedule untill ther are no confilcts of interest. So no overbooked rooms, no students that have two classes at the same time, and the sequence of the sessions are always correct. Present your data in the format that is comparable to the example in the csv-file directory </p>
